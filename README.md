empeg-remote
============

Releasing the source since I no longer have time to work on it.

NOTE: Your player MUST have a recent version of the Hijack kernel installed (http://empeg-hijack.sourceforge.net)

This app allows you to control the Empeg on a phone or tablet and provides the full functionality of the original remote control as well as full playlist navigation and control. Colors can be customized to fit the lens color of your Empeg. The app also employs discovery to automatically find Empegs on the network.

Continued thanks and praise to the Empeg guys for giving us a great gift, which has lasted for nearly 15 years(!)
